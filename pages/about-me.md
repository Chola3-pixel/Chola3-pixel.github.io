  bio: |
    I’m currently a Senior studying Electrical Engineering at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. I expect to graduate this upcoming fall semester. I will be working on a Senior project that entails the prevention and detection of eavesdropping on a system's Network. Als,o after graduation, I plan on getting my master's degree immediately.

    In my free time, I go to the gym, read, and play video games. Also learning a new hobby, which is DJing. So in my spare time, I spend my time doing. Also, plan on learning Portuguese since I'm planning a trip to Brazil and I want to be well-versed in the language.
