subtitle: Proactive Defense System
project_title: "Proactive Defense System for Unforeseen Adversarial Attacks"

problem: |
  Today's challenges in existing cyber defense systems are largely reactiveâ€”effective against known adversarial attacks, but not unseen or novel threats. A major concern is that many current defense mechanisms rely on static rules and predefined signatures.

  How can we improve defense systems to stay ahead of constantly evolving threats?

  Our proposed Proactive Defense System will use neural networks as a base for learning. We will train these networks to extract features from prior attack vectors and recognize patterns to anticipate future threats.

approach: |
  The project follows a pipeline:

  - Read and discuss selected scholarly conference and journal papers.
  - Understand the project plan for implementing a proactive detection system for unforeseen cyberattacks.
  - Develop an operational Proactive Detection System for cyberattacks.
  - Aim to publish results.

  Prerequisites include basic computer programming in C++ and Python, knowledge of mathematics (especially vector/matrix operations), and foundational knowledge of AI/ML. Participants should also have an interest in advanced ML algorithms, communication networks, cybersecurity, and IoT systems.

outcome: |
  This program will equip participants with advanced skills in communication networking, cybersecurity, and ML systems tailored for cyberattack detection on IoT devices.

  Students will also have the opportunity to enhance critical thinking through basic research and the development of complex ML systems.
