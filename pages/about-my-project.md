subtitle: Proactive Defense System
project_title: "Proactive Defense System for Unforeseen Adversarial Attacks"

problem: |
  Today challenges in existing cyber defense systems are majorly reactive against known adversarial attacks but not to unseen attacks. The growing concerns with current defense mechanisms are solely relying on static rules and predefined signatures to protect against threats.  
  How can we improve defense systems to stay ahead of the constantly evolving threats?
Our proposed Proactive Defense System is expected to use neural networks as a base system for learning. We will train our neural networks to learn features across several tasks such as prior attack vectors. 

approach: |
  The project follows a pipeline:

  - Read and discuss selected scholarly conference and journal papers.
  - Understand the project plan for implementing a Proactive Detecting System for unforeseen cyberattacks.
  - Develop an operational ProactiveDetection System for cyberattacks
  - Publication

  Basic computer programming in C++ and PythonKnowledge of Mathematics especially vector/matrix operations, Basic Knowledge of AI/ML Have an interest in learning advanced ML algorithms, communication networks, cybersecurity, and IoT systems.

  
outcome: |
 The outcomes of this program will equip participants with advanced skills in communication networking, cybersecurity, and ML systems tailored for cyberattack detection on IoT devices.The students will have opportunities to advance critical thinking skills in conducting basic research to develop complex ML systems by understanding legend ML algorithms for detecting cyberattacks. Additionally, they will acquire basic software programming skills in developing a ML system, system integration for IoT devices, and software configuration for networking by exchanging data over wireless links. Moreover, contribution to this project complements
security solutions for IoT safety and the protection of data information across data links in communication networks.
