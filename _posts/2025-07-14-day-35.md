what_i_learned: |
  In this new set of code, I learned how to structure a modular machine learning project with reusable components like models, attacks, and training utilities. I  implemented an adversarial training in PyTorch, focusing on building specialist models to defend against specific attack types such as PGD and FGSM. I also learned how to manage the Python path and package structure in Google Colab to ensure my modules load correctly. The code would track, visualize, and build a better, scalable AI defense pipeline.

  No blockers

reflection: |
  Today I had a new model that I was working on, which is an improvement from my old one, so I just worked on making sure that all libraries that needed to be installed were installed correctly. Once they were installed, I ran the code and now im just waiting to see my results.
