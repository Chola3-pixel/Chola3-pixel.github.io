what_i_learned: |
  I learned a little bit more about our next steps after the completion of phase 1. This is for prep for the presentation this Friday. I also continued working on integrating my code with the base model for our project to see how it could improve. Lastly, I started rereading the article that supports our project just so that I can strengthen the foundation of what I know to prepare for our presentations.

reflection: |
  Today wasn't much mainly just started on our presentations for the mid-summer symposium. We assigned roles for who's going to be doing what. Then just individually started working on our respective parts.
