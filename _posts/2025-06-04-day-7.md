what_i_learned: |
  I learned more about the datasets that we will be using when we start coding. There are 5 major datasets that we will be utilizing to help create a proactive detection system against these adversarial attacks. Which is Scipy, Matplotlib, Numpy, pandas, and sklearn.
  Each of these datasets has its respective jobs within the code that will help identify strategies to generalize defense across different types of attacks.

  No blockers

reflection: |
  Today was cool, did some more of a literature review utilizing different LLMS to see how different each of them was in the breakdown  of the analysis of the article we are reading. The LLM that made the  reading understanding was Grok. But Copilot broke down each dataset within the code the best.
