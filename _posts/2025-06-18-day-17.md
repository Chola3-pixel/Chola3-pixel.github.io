what_i_learned: |
  I learned that gaussian denoising  highlights the importance of pre-processing steps in defending against attacks such as PGD ) and JPEG-style perturbations, which simulate real-world noise. I learned that through the inner-loop gradients  update using fast weights and outer-loops meta-update using an Adam optimizer. Also, I learned how the meta-training loop mimics few-shot learning by allowing the model to generalize from limited labeled examples across tasks.

  It was exciting to get to know and learn more about the teacher that would be working with us for the rest of the program. Look forawrd to working with him. Finally got the results from my code and got close to 86% accuracry on the clean data which is way better than what I had before. Only problem is that on the attkacks I got like 20% accuracy which means I need to improve my Code some more. The lost at sea portion of the enrichment time was also fun. I think my group did pretty well with organizing and getting close to what the coast guard deemed the list should be. Lowkey shocked me how low they put the rum though. Forsure thought it would be higher since it can be used for medical situations which I would consider highly important if I was lost at sea.
