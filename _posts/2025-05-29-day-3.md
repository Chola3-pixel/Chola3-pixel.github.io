what_i_learned: |
 Today I learned about Computer Vision from the mentor Andrew Kelly.Learned what the difference between image classification and object detection are. We used a website called teachablemachine to take snapshots of different images that we have in our room. With each item we gave their own class and then trained the model to recognize each class. So that once its trained it will recognize what the object is whenever that said object is placed in the camera. Also ran code in COLAB used code called YOLO. This code takes the image we upload and identifies a specific object and recognizes it amongst other objects in the image. In todays python session I learned how what type casting is and what the type() function does. I also learned how ints and floats can be turned into string and how to do it the other way around.Overall learned the basic steps of building an algorithm in python.

 example of code learned today used COLAB: "ultralytics import YOLO
model= YOLO ('yolov8n-seg.pt')
results = model('lambo.jpeg',save=True)"  

reflection: |
  Today was another informative day learning about the teachable machine and COlAB. Also learning more skills in python helped improve my skills and i look forward to applying them when we start the program next week. Lastly I had fun playing the escape with my project group, and coming in first place felt great. With the way my group worked during the escape room portion. I belieev that my project group will have a great team dynamic this summer.
