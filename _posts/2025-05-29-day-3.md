what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about Computer Vision from the mentor Andrew Kelly. I learned what the difference between image classification and object detection is.
  We used a website called Teachable Machine to take snapshots of different images in our room. For each item, we gave it its own class and then trained
  the model to recognize each class. Once trained, it could recognize objects when placed in front of the camera.

  We also ran code in Google Colab using YOLO (You Only Look Once). This code takes the image we upload and identifies specific objects within it.

  In today’s Python session, I learned about type casting and what the type() function does. I also learned how to convert between strings, integers,
  and floats. Overall, I learned the basic steps of building an algorithm in Python.

  Example of code learned today using Colab:
  
  ```python
  from ultralytics import YOLO
  model = YOLO('yolov8n-seg.pt')
  results = model('lambo.jpeg', save=True)


reflection: |
  Today was another informative day learning about the teachable machine and Colab. Also learning more skills in python helped improve  my skills and i look forward to applying them when we start the program next week. Lastly I had fun playing the escape with my    project group, and coming in first place felt great. With the way my group worked during the escape room portion. I believe that my    project group will have a great team dynamic this summer.
