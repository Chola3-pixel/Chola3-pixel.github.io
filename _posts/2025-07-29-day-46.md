what_i_learned: |
  Today, we met with Dr.Cole to discuss our slides and paper. He gave us some feedback on what he thinks of our slides. From that feedback, we had a couple of little things to change, nothing too drastic. So he liked most of our content on our slides. He also gave us feedback on our paper, and we had more things to change than we had to do for the slides. The feedback he gave us on our paper was very insightful because, from what he said that the way we put our results in our paper would have gotten us discredited because of the format.

reflection: |
  I can't wait to present on Thursday. I still need to practice what I am going to say, but I have been working on how I want to format what I will be presenting on Thursday. I am struggling a little bit  with putting my thoughts into words, so when I go home, I plan on working on how best I can break down the explanation I want to present. Also, with Dr. Cole's feedback, I learned something new. You can't post results in a paper a certain way. So I am glad he looked at that before we submitted it.
