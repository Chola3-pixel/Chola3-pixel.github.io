what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about the Naive Bayes Algorithm. I learned that the Naive Bayes assumes features have independence and uses the Bayes Theorem to predict class identification based on prior and likelihood probabilities. The difference between prior and likelihood is that prior is predetermined and is learned from a set of training samples. While Likelihood is how likely a feature is to coincide with a certain class. Also learned the different types of NaiveBAyes classifiers which are Gaussian, Bernoulli, and multinomial.

  It was exciting to learn about the Naive Bayes algorithm and how it can be used. One way it can be used is to split emails into spam and nonspam sections. It was cool to learn how the mail app utilizes this algorithm. The only thing that I would have to look into is that although we can utilize the algorithm for our project. How would you convert images to numbers within the algorithm you can assign words to numbers to help with classification.
