what_i_learned: |
  I learned what Git & GitHub were, I also learned new facts about my peers. One interesting thing was learning about what a repository is on GitHub and how I can edit and modify it.  
   I also started exploring the different commands on git, for example, what clone does and how two people cant commit changes at the same time. 
blockers: |
  No blockers

reflection: |
  It was exciting to learn more about the people I will be working with during the duration of this program. Also was cool to learn who does and knows what during the bingo game and how GitHub works
