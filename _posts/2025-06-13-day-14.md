what_i_learned: |
  I learned more about the implementation of the code for my project. I ran a version of it today and ran into some issues with it being not as accurate. So I had to change some code up specifically within the hyperparameters. I'm not able to see the results yet just because the run time for this program takes a while to complete.
   I also started exploring the next phase of what we will be doing once we finish our first phase in our talk with Dr.Cole today.
   I also have to prepare and give a mini presentation to him next week on my finished code and everything I have learned. i also learned once we finish the python implementation we will be converting it to c++
blockers: |
  No blockers

reflection: |
  I still have to fix some of my code because it is far from being done. When it finished running it was only one percent accurate so over the weekend I'm gonna work on it to get closer to the percentage I need. Also, it was exciting to learn more about the next phase we would be working on once we finish the implementation of everything we have learned in Python.
