  It was exciting to learn about the writing process from the writing center. The session gave me different insights into the steps of writing a paper. Helped visualize what my group would have to do once it comes time to write our final paper. It was also cool learning about the lady who has written a lot of papers and is from Nigeria, doing a study on medicinal plants and whether they can help with the cure for cancer. Today's code was also calm. I just ran my code and waited for it to finish running.
