  It was exciting to learn about the writing process from the writing center. The session gave me different insights on the steps of writing a paper. Helped visualize what my groupd would have to do once it comes time to write our final paper. it was also cool learning about the lady who has written alot of papers and is from Nigeria doing a study on medicinal plants and if they can help with the cure for cancer. Today code was also calm just ran my code and waited for it to finish running.
