what_i_learned: |
   Today, I worked on improving my model's robustness by adjusting PGD attack strength across the training epochs, which simulates better evolving threats. I did this by combining a ResNet-based model with a Learn2Learnâ€™s MAML framework. I also updated what I worked on yesterday by organizing the checkpoints to store the model, optimizer, scheduler, and epoch state.

  No blockers

reflection: |
  Today was another calm day. Although I ran out of GPU runtime and have to pay again, so that when I run my code, it runs and produces results faster. Lowkey sucks because I didnt know I would have to be paying to run my code.
