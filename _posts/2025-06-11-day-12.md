what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about SVM( Support Vector Machine). It's a supervised learning model primarily used for classification tasks. It finds a hyperplane (or decision boundary) in a high-dimensional space that best separates samples of different classes. The idea is to maximize  the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class. This maximized margin helps the model generalize better to unseen data. SVMs handle text classification using techniques like tf-idf. Term Frequency (tf) measures how often a term (word) appears in a specific document. It reflects the importance of a word within a single document. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) measures how important or rare a word is across all documents in a collection.

  It was a little rough today. I didn't really understand some of the content we were going over today which was SVM and the hyperplane. So I plan on reading more on what and how to use SVM when I get home. Although I seen how we would implement it in our project when identifying unforeseen attacks.
