what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about NLP(Natural Language Processing). NLPs deal with interactions between mchines and human languages. They consist of oral,writte and etc. types of language. NLPS come in all different forms of tasks such as voice commands, social media posts, medical prescriptions and etc. I also learned some python code on how to access NLP libraries. One form og a NLP is tokenization, this is when sentences are broken upinto fragments. They can be broken up into unigrams,bigrams, trigrams or n-grams.This is to extract features of a senetence for a machine model to learn. 
  While practing with the NLP libraries I learned about how within a dataset you can identify target names that can have an associated integer. Also learned you can display the frequency count of words and convert the collection of text within a document to a matrix of tokens.
  Lastly, lemmentization is th process of grouping or linking words that have a similar meaning to one particular word. For example better and good could be linked together during lemmatization.

  It was exciting to learn about the Natural Language processing that machine models use. It was also cool to learn some new coding skills that i can utilize for our project. Look forward to what I will learn tomorrow.
