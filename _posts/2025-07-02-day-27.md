  I mainly focused on working and prepping for the presentation. So I didn't learn much today 
blockers: |
  No blockers

reflection: |
  Today I ran some more code, I had to reset my code because of my library issues. Once I fixed that I ran my code and just waited for it to execute. While I waited I also worked on the presentation for tomorrow. Honestly nervous about this presentation now.        Alright, it's 15 minutes from when I started this first paragraph not as nervous now after doing some more trial runs and practicing what I am going to say. I feel more confident, just hoping I don't rush and fumble over my words.
