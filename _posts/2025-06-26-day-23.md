what_i_learned: |
 Today I learned that the model that I am using might not be the best so I have been trying to learn what I can do to rebuild and change it to where it is improving. The baseline model that was given to me mixed with my model significantly decreased the accuracy of my results. For instance, when I first saw my results it was at 80-something percent. Then when I ran it again it was at like 14 percent. I've been tryna figure out what caused it and I think it's because of the SVM model that I implemented. But im gonna look more into it to see what the problem is.

reflection: |
  Today we met with Dr.Cole to go over what our presentation looked like so far. From what he said it looked alright but we still have some things to fix before the presentation next week. So we'll work on it more than present it to him on Tuesday again to go over before the actual presentation. Lowkey bummed I have to restart the implementation of my code again, though I was finally getting somewhere. I realized halfway through the day my code wasn't executing what exactly I wanted it to when I saw the results it gave me. Somehow my Clean accuracy decreased by a lot. Tryna figure out how that happened since the results before were significantly higher and I didn't change much.
