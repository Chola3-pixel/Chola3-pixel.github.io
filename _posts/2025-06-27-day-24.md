what_i_learned: |
  I how to properly install a model called learn2learn. I have been struggling with the download of this model for like two weeks, but now I have figured it out. I had to clone and install the model from GitHub in order for it to run properly. I learned  realized that for my clean accuracy and adversarial accuracy to be high I would need the learn2learn module. This is because without it, it was just training but it wasn't learning from the training that it was doing. So with this model, it will adapt faster to attack from what it has learned.

  No blockers

reflection: |
  Today I made what I hope is some good progress in my code despite the minor setback I had yesterday. I was finally able to implement the learn2learn module in my code. Now I am just waiting on its execution and I believe that once it's done running my accuracy will increase for both my clean and adversarial attacks. I'm also happy the weekend is here.
