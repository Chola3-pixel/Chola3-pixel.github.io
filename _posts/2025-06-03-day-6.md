what_i_learned: |
  I learned the foundations of what my project will be built on, from multiple readings that back the project plan. So I learned that the goal of this project is to test the development of a robust defense system against adversarial attacks. I also learned that this would be done by training a model on two types of attacks a seen and an unforeseen attack. So with attack type A, we would feed it images that it would learn from during the training phase. Then during the testing phase, the attacks that it wasn't taught how to defend against would attack the system. This is so that the system will learn how to adapt its parameters based on the attacks it has seen and use that defense to defend against unforeseen attacks.

  No blockers

reflection: |
  It was exciting to learn more and read about the foundation of what this project entails, and how we would be training our model to learn the how of defense and not the what specifically not memorizing specific defense types.
