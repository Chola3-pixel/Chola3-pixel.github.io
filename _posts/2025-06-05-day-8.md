what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned more about the libraries that were in the code that we will be using. Also learned what an epoch is in AI machine learning which is when a model takes what it's learned from the dataset during training and passes it on to the testing phase. Then runs it back one full cycle of what would be considered an epoch.

reflection: |
  Today was cool. The first half of the day took a tour of campus even though I already knew what the campus looked like. It was hot, but at least I was able to get my steps in. Also felt like it was a good time because I got to meet and talk with some people who were not a part of my group. In today's session for my group, we ran a small section of code that would run 5 epochs. At first, I ran into many issues with my code whenever I tried to fix it I would still run into some more issues. Finally, I changed up what i could in the code which was that one of the libraries wasn't fully downloaded once i fixed that I got it to run and was able to see how a it analyzes the code with the epoch
