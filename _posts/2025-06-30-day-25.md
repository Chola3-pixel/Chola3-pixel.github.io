what_i_learned: |
  Today in my code, I ran into an issue where I was trying to call `set_params` on a TorchAttack object. I learned that TorchAttacks doesn't support parameter updates like this after initialization. To make it work, I had to reinitialize the attack object with new parameters each time I needed a change.

reflection: |
  Today we finished our parts for the presentation. Surprisingly, I don't feel nervous right now—which is unusual for me since I normally dread presentations. I also worked more on my code implementation and ran into the same library installation issue again. Initially, I couldn't resolve it, but eventually, I fixed it. Now I'm just waiting on the results.
