    Today in my code I ran into an issue where I was calling set parameters on a torch attack. I learned i couldn't do that though because torch attacks don't support this after it has been initialized so for it to work I had to create a new set of parameters that new attack types.

reflection: |
    Today we finished our parts for our presentations. Surprisingly I don't feel nervous right now. I usually do when I know 
  I have a presentation coming up simply because  I hate presentations. I also worked some more on my code implementation, I ran into the issue I was having again with the Library install. At first, I couldn't resolve it but then I fixed it again. Now just waiting again for my results.
