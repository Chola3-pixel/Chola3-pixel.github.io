what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to implement checkpointing in my meta-adversarial training loop, allowing my model to automatically save and resume progress. This is especially useful when working in environments like Google Colab, where long training sessions can be interrupted. I also improved the robustness of my model by dynamically adjusting the strength of PGD attacks over time. These updates made my code more efficient.

  No blockers

reflection: |
  Today was a pretty chill day. Just looked for more ways to improve my code. Implemented checkpointing in my code because sometimes when  my code would sit for a while it would stop running and when i run it again it would start over instead of just starting from where it last left off.
