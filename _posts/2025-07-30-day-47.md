what_i_learned: |
  Today we did test runs on the presentation. Went through different mock trials of practicing what we are gonna say.
blockers: |
  No blockers

reflection: |
  It's the day before our presentation, and honestly, during our mock trials I was struggling with what I had to say. It was pissing me off because I wasn't sure if I was messing up do to being tired or me being nervous about tomorrow, I also know it's because I hate presentations. So I am gonna rehearse all day on what I have to say to make sure that I am more confident when it comes to the presentation tomorrow.
