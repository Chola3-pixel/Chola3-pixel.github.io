reflection: |
  Today we went over our presentation prep with Dr.Cole and got feedback on our presentation. The feedback was good we had minor mistakes we had to change. I am feeling  50/50 on the presentation  we have. Kind of nervous kind of not. Also didn't really focus much on my code today just did mainly presentation prep. Was happy that we got dismissed early.
