what_i_learned: |
  I learned about the functions of Overleaf and how it's used for documentation. Also in today's section of our lab, we ran a bigger dataset to see how our computers with a smaller GPU than the computer we will use would react to that large dataset. At first, my laptop couldn't run the program well so I changed a few things in the code and now it's running well. I just have to wait for it to be completed which would be around tomorrow morning.

reflection: |
  Today I had a lot of fun during the Cohort Block. My favorite part was when we played taboo. I had fun because at first my team was down by a lot and when all doubted us we came back. Like Lebron James and Kyrie in the 2016 finals. It was great seeing everybody have a time just joking around and being competitive. Can't wait till the next Cohort session and what's in store for us then.
