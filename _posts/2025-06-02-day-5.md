what_i_learned: |
  Today Dr. Waters talked to and during herseesion I learned what the difference between a independent and dependent variable are and how they take a factor in how we would conduct research with AI. So for example we would have a reaserch question that AI is trying to solve and to do this the dependent variable would have specfic parameters that fit the question and then it would send some nodes to the independent where variable which would tell those nodes that this is how you can answer those questions. Then those nodes would be sent back to the dependent variable after being trained and would update those paraemeters within the dependents, and in order to have these constant updates you would want atleast 1,000 training models that would be sent back and forth within each update. Lastly something new I learned that applies to this is RAG which is a Regenrative-Auggmented-Generation. 
   I also had time with my advisor and graduate mentor to learn more about what our project would entail and how we will move forward from here.

Look forward to working on my project for this summer. After hearing about the full details of what me and team would be working on. Also it was fun trying to build the tallest tower that could hold up a marshemellow. Although we didnt get the highest one our tower still stood tall.
