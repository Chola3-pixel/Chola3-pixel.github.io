what_i_learned: |
  I successfully learned about condition statements so like  If else and Elif statements. ALso learned about how Python utilizes the boolean table to run code based on input. So for example two truths = a truth, and two false = false statement. Also learned about the different rational operators and how they can be used in boolean operations.

  Gen AI and LLMS. Learned that the are able to generate logical sequences, make predictions and generate solutions. While also being able to singulate reasoning to answer questions or solve problems with the things it has learned. I also learned that goal of AI initially was to mimc human intelligence using just rules and logic.
   
  LLMs uses tokenization which turns text into smaller chunks for processing. LLMS are also trained with Books,Wikipedia,Webbsites,code and Academic papers. Learned that LLMS learn how to recognize and mimic language patterns, structures and its relationships.

reflection: |
  The Bot or not game was fun, crazy to me how realistic some of these images that were ai generated looked really caught my neck. Cause I really thought they were real. Just shows advanced AI is. Also the Kahoot games for python really helped reinforce all the information learned. During the Gen AI protion  when my peers used suno and c.ai it had me crying cause of how funny the characters were.But it was also cool how AI takes your sugesstions and can make whatever type of music you want. Heard some interesting genres i would have never thought of. I also wonder if in the future with the Character AI if that would take over human interactions amongst each other. When we have this available to us at anytime.
