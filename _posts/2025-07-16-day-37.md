what_i_learned: |
  Today, I got some new code from my groupmate and ran it on 10 epochs while he ran his on 100. I ran the code on an A100 GPU. So far, it's at 5/10 epochs and is on 50/1000 tasks.

  No blockers

reflection: |
  Today was calm, just waiting for my code to finish running. Sadly, I don't think it's gonna finish before I run out of runtime units.
