what_i_learned: |
  I learned some categories of Machine Learning. The three categories we went over were Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is when learning data comes with features that describe the data then based on those descriptions it knows what labels to classify that data with. Unsupervised learning is when the machine has no labels or descriptions of the data, So the machine has to look at how the data is structured and then use what it has learned from this structure and classify it with a label. Reinforcement learning is when you give the model something to recognize and label and when it labels it wrong you give it  negative feedback. Meaning that it has identified something wrong. So then it takes that feedback learns from it and now recognizes that whenever it sees that certain object it will give that object the right label classification.

   I also started exploring a machine learning project and within that project, I looked at how to define a problem, prepare data, evaluate algorithms, improve results, and present results.

  It was exciting to learn more about the concepts of machine learning and how little by little the small steps we are taking will take place in the implementation of our project design. Also during the weekend, I plan on looking more at my code to understand why I was getting errors and how I can fix those errors.
