what_i_learned: |
  I learned about the library that was giving me issues with my code and what it specifically does. Learn2learn library is a meta-learning toolkit for PyTorch. It provides high-level abstractions to help implement  learning. I realized I'm not gonna be able to use this  library but another for when I implement a learning base for my model. Today I also took the code I have and implemented it with another baseline model but ran into some errors. I didn't get a chance to look at the errors in detail but plan on it later on in the day.

  No blockers

  Today we met with Dr.Cole and did a presentation on what we have learned and done which is to prepare us for next week's midsummer presentation. Also feel like I'm  heading in the right direction with my code. The accuracy is gradually increasing.
