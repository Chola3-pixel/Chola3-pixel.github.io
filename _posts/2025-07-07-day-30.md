what_i_learned: |
  I learned more about what the coming stages of our project plan are. Also learned about what we hope will come. We hope that once we get better accuracy from testing and training, we can convert the Python code to C++. I also learned that if that doesn't work out, our plan B will be to take that Python code and run it directly to the IoT device, but we would rather convert to C++ since it's easier for the devices. I also learned that with the IoT devices, when we upload the code to them. The device would only have to run the test and skip the training step.

  No blockers

reflection: |
  Today was exciting. We went to check the IoT devices that will be used when we are done with code implementation and cross-checked that they were working in the lab. I felt like a kid in a candy store, and also felt like it was Christmas once I saw all the devices and what the final look of everything would be when they come together.
