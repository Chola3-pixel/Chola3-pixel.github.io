what_i_learned: |
  I learned that by integrating my adversarial training with denoising and feature-based classification algorithms together then my code will become more robust in defending against adversarial attacks.  The combinatin of the two algorithms will train a ResNet18 model enhanced with a denoise block, that allows for  it to better handle perturbed inputs. I input some code that  includes checkpoints for  every 20 epochs, training to resume after interruption especially for when my computer turns off.

  No blockers

 Worked some more on the integration of my code. I also implemented some new pieces of code that I hope will better the runtime on my model (HOPEFULLY), Im gonna run my code at home to see if it has improved the accuracy and runtime. Also lowkey was excited to hear that I might be gettiing my first paycheck this thursday. Did some more work on my slides for the presentation. Not as nervous as I was before. Though I still hate presentations, so hopefully Im good by friday.
