what_i_learned: |
  I learned how to establish reliable communication between two ESP32 devices over Wi-Fi using a  TCP protocol. I also learned the steps of how to configure one ESP32 as a TCP server (receiver) that listens on a specific port and IP address, while the other acts as a TCP client (sender) that connects to it and sends data. The device will also be running on an Arduino.

  No blockers

reflection: |
  It was exciting to learn more about the device we will be uploading our code to and its configuration. I have some experience working with Arduinos, but today was my first time hearing about what the ESP32 is. So I found it interesting learning about a new device. Also, the writing workshop was cool, learned some new info that will help when we start our paper.
