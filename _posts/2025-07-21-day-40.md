  Today I learned I learned some new skills in overleaf. That will be useful when we write our paper. Learned about how to edit the baseline document that was given to us, and how to change it up for our final paper.

reflection: |
  It was exciting to learn more about the overleaf process that will be used when editing for our final paper. I also spent the rest f the day working on my part for our final paper and discussed with the group ideas that we have for our 90 sec commercial. I like the idea we came up with. Hopefully we can perfectly execute it once we start working on it tomorrow.
