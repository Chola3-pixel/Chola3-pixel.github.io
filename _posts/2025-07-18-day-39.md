what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about converting our final code into C++ and some of the differences between the two that we will have to look into. To make sure that when we convert, nothing drastic changes and gets messed up when it's in C++. I also learned a little bit more about the ESP32 that we were working on yesterday, and how communication works between the receiver and sender.

reflection: |
  Today, we met with Dr.Cole and just discussed what is expected of us for these last two weeks. We also discussed where we are in our stages and what our plan is for our final paper. It was also a calm day was just looking into ways that we can convert our code into C++ for once our Python code is finalized after the meta training and testing.
