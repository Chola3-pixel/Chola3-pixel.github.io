what_i_learned: |
  First learned more about the different advisors and their projects. Then I joined a breakout room and learned more about my advisor and mentor and what they want us to do to prepare for the project we will be working on. After meeting with our advisors learned about how to make some more edits on the repository. Lastly, today I learned some basics of Python that will help enhance my skills. For example, I learned three different types of data structures, which are: strings, integers, and floats.

reflection: |
 Today was fun. Meeting with my advisor and just learning about the project we will be working on was cool. Can't wait to start! As someone who isn't too good at coding, it was very  informative learning more about Python. During the last session, i had a fun time playing the headbandz game, great time to decompress after the day.
