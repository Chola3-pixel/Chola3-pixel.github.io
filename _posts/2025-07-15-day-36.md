what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about what my personality and learning styles are. My results from the personality test were that I am considered an ISTP, which means I lean more towards  introversion, sensation, thinking, and perception. It says that ISTPs are very sensitive to their surroundings and are interested in the way things work, but find abstract concepts tedious if they cannot put them into practice. There's more, but this describes me to the T. I also learned that my learning style is multimodal and that I am a good mix of all the different types of learning styles (VARK). Lastly, I learned more about my group members' learning styles and the rest of the members of the cohort's learning styles.

reflection: |
  Today's Cohort session was fun. Learning about my learning style  and personality was very cool. It was crazy to me how the results of the personality test low-key described me. I usually don't believe in these online tests like that; sometimes I think they are flawed. Also had fun learning more about others in the cohort through their presentations and the bingo game.
