reflection: |
  TGIF, end of the week kind of happy, lowkey need this weekend. My code this past week has been running slower, and I haven't been able to see the results of my code. Meaning I haven't been able to see if the things I have implemented this week have improved my accuracy or not. Although today I was able to get a better GPU, so over the weekend I'm going to run my code, and I expect to be able to see results before the start of next week. Hopefully, my accuracy has increased, and my code has improved.
